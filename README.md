# HDL Editor

## Introduction

The application is designed to generate structured Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language) code for FPGA devices. The design, or the Verilog code is fully synchronous.

The application is implemented in F#. The source code is transpiled to JavaScript by the Fable compiler and bundled by webpack. The result JavaScript code runs under the Electron framework with GUI set by HTML and CSS files.

## Feature

The software is a fully graphical FPGA hardware design tool. For creating custom logic blocks, user can either fill in truth tables to generate a standalone block, or connect different logic blocks together to form a higher level block.

The application is designed to be cross-platform, either for production use or development purposes.

## Code Structure

The F# source code is placed in three projects and transpiled to JavaScript.

The electron main process handles tasks such as creating windows and providing browser-like platform to run the code.

The electron renderer process handles such as GUI update and user interaction.

The two kinds of processes can communicate with each other via IPC (Inter-Process Communication) calls or via the Remove module, which is a one way communication from the renderer process to the main process.

| Process           | Project                                                | Source                          | Executable Code                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| electron main     | .src/Main/Main.fsproj                                  | .src/Main/Main.fs               | .app/js/main.js                  |
| electron renderer | .src/Renderer/Renderer.fsproj                          | .src/Renderer/*.fs              | .app/js/renderer.js              |
| electron renderer | .src/blockConfigureWindow /blockConfigureWindow.fsproj | .src/blockConfigureWindow /*.fs | .app/js /blockConfigureWindow.js |



## `package.json`

The electron framework is built upon Node.js and follows the typical file structure for a Node project.

The `package.json` is the configuration file for the project, including information such as package dependency, scripts and copyright.

```
{
  ...
"scripts": {
  "start": "cd src/Main && yarn webpack --port free -w --config webpack.config.js -w",
  "build": "cd src/Main && yarn webpack --port free --config webpack.config.js",
  "launch": "electron . -w",
  },
  ...
}  
```

The `script` section in `package.json` defines shortcut commands. To run the defined commands, simply type `yarn + <script key>` in the terminal followed by the `Enter` key.

Native node `npm` commands are also supported. To run the defined shortcut commands, type `npm run <script key>` followed by the `Enter` key.

## `webpack.config.js`

The file is used to configure webpack, the bundler. The file sets the entry point and the output directory for different F# projects.

Webpack configuration is loaded when `yarn start` is running in the command line interface. The webpack can be configured to watch any changes in the source file and automatically re-bundle.

If the webpack configuration file is changed, the `yarn start` process needs to be restarted in order to allow the changes to take effect.

## File Structure

### `app` folder

The folder contains the HTML and CSS files for setting and styling the GUI. The CSS files are put in a separate folder called `css/`.

The transpiled JavaScript code is put in the `js/` subfolder, as configured in the `webpack.config.js` file.

### `src` folder

The folder contains F# projects. Each F# project is put in a subfolder. The structure of each subfolder is auto-generated by Visual Studio.

## Getting Started

## Reinstalling Compiler and Libraries

For Windows users, run `setup.bat` file at the root directory.

For Mac and Linux users, run `setup.sh` file at the root directory.

## Packaging the Application

| Operating System | Command           |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Windows          | `yarn pack-win`   |
| Mac              | `yarn pack-mac`   |
| Linux            | `yarn pack-linux` |

Please run each command under its corresponding operating system.

## Dependency Upgrade

- The project uses the Fable 2.0.3. At the time of development, Fable 3 is under development while not officially released.

- JointJS version 2.2.1. Its commercial extension Rappid is not needed.

- Electron version 4.1.3

- Dotnet SDK version 2.1

- Webpack version 4.29.6

## Boilplate Development

The F# projects are controlled by the HDL_Editor.sln file, which is used as the Visual Studio solution file. By openning the file using Visual Studio, all F# projects are accessible in one window.

Open two terminals with one running `yarn start` and the other running `yarn launch`. When any changes are made to the F# source code, saving the changes will trigger the automatic re-transpile of the changed files. The `yarn launch` command needs to be stopped and re-run to make the changes in the source code take effect.
